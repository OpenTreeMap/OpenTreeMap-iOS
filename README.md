# OpenTreeMap for iOS

## Getting Started

OpenTreeMap for iOS has 2 major dependencies:

  - An OpenTreeMap web application installation
  - A "skin," which is a set of images and configurations files

The source for the OpenTreeMap web application is available on github

<a href="https://github.com/azavea/OpenTreeMap">https://github.com/azavea/OpenTreeMap</a>

A default skin can be downloaded using the Fabric (http://docs.fabfile.org/) script included with the OpenTreeMap for iOS source.

    $ fab install_skin
    $ fab create_info_plist:app_name={app name},bundle_id={bundle id}

The default skin may also be found on github
